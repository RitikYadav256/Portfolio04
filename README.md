# Portfolio04
This is a full-stack portfolio website designed to professionally showcase my skills, projects, experience, and contact information using a combination of modern frontend and backend technologies. Unlike static portfolios, this dynamic web app includes a backend server to manage project data, a contact form with real email sending, and admin capabilities to update content securely.

The website is built with a React.js frontend for a smooth and interactive UI and a Node.js + Express backend with optional MongoDB integration for dynamic content and form handling.
